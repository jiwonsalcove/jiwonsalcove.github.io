This is my personal website coded in [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) static site generator, HTML with [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/), and raw CSS. Instead of adopting a template, I coded this template from scratch to suit my specific needs by referencing [eleventy-base-blog](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog) and [this tutorial post](https://sia.codes/posts/itsiest-bitsiest-eleventy-tutorial/). I rely almost entirely on HTML and markdown templates using Liquid instead of alternatives such as nunjucks due to its simplicity.
