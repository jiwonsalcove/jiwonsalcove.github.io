Ever since discovering Leo Babauta's _Zen Habits_ blog, I became a minimalist overnight. I was young at the time, so my lifestyle transformation was confined to decluttering the personal possessions in my room. 

That wave of minimalism around the 2000s and early 2010s was led by Buddhist practitioners in the West and what we now call Japanese extreme minimalism in the East. It was characterized by making lists of one's possessions, and living with a low number, which was typically in the low hundreds. Many followers had strong motivation to own very few items, such as travelling around the world or living in disaster-prone areas. 

As I became a seasoned minimalist, I moved onto college dorms and, eventually, standard surburban American houses. Thoughout this time, my minimalism waxed and waned. I never became a full maximalist or a materialist by any definition of those words, but I have, in occasion, had periods where I made a number of material purchases. 

By that time, the public perception of minimalism had changed. Marie Kondo's _The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up_ reached the US in 2014, and the Netflix documentary _Minimalism_ by the eponymous _The Minimalists_ blew up in 2015. Both works promote a more moderate approach to minimalism. The difference is evident in Marie Kondo's criterion for keeping an item, "does the item spark joy?", which, to the sentimental type, could be used to justify not decluttering at all. 

Hence, mainstream minimalists and extreme minimalists split off into separate communities. Extreme minimalists count possessions from the bottom-up; mainstream minimalists declutter from the top-down. Extreme minimalists may get rid of furniture, useful tools, and sentimental items, in order to achieve the state of owning only the essentials; mainstream minimalists tend to keep some creature comfort. Extreme minimalists tend not to own items that are rarely used, such as tools or cutlery for guests, choosing to borrow from others instead; mainstream minimalists prefer otherwise. 

Having grown up with the early wave of minimalists, now labeled extreme, I have a soft heart for the empty room, which, in its transient state before rubbish inevitably finds its way, gives me a sense of peace. Stuff stresses me out. Alas, we need things to live, especially if you, like me, live in a standard single family home with a non-minimalist. I now describe myself an extreme minimalist at heart. The state of owning the essentials and nothing else is an ideal state of being, which will never come to be. My life is a constant tug-and-pull between my desire to own less junk, and my desire for creature comfort, nice things, and living with others. 

One conflict that frequently arises is between my ideal of extreme minimalism and saving time. One one hand I'd like to live in a bare room; on the other, I despise wasting my finite time doing tasks that could be automated by machines.
