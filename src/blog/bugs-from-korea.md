Over the past summer, I went on a camping trip with my family to a remote mountain range in what is roughly at the center of South Korea. I couldn't fall asleep at the tent for the life of me, with the hard surface and noise from nocturnal singing bugs. So, I went out walking looking for bugs that are drawn by the light. I wasn't disappointed!

A male _Prismognathus dauricus_ stag beetle. It is native to the Korean peninsula and Manchuria. It is small, yet exquisite.

A female stag beetle, of what I think is the _Serrognathus titanus_ species. Very common across mountain ranges in Korea.

A _Tenodera sp._ praying mantis.

What I believe to be _Teleogryllus emma_, the most common species of crickets in Korea.

Moths, which I don't know how to ID.

A tiny jumping spider that is feeding on some sort of a prey.

Cicadas were also a common sight. The first has some sort of a parasitic wasp or fungus attached to it. The second probably have just molted, hence why it's white.
