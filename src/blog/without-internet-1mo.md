A month ago, I expressed a desire to live [without](/blog/without) optional websites as infinite feeds were making me feel overwhelmed. It's been a month and the experiment was largely a failure. 

These addictive websites prey upon my lowest moments. If I am having a great day, then abstaining is easy. On the bad days, doomscrolling is a surefire drug to quell depression and anxiety. 

Although most social media websites are a waste of time, my main vices Youtube and Reddit are often valuable sources of information. As such, a flat-out ban hindered my work on the good days, and I still ended up doomscrolling on the bad days. 

As such, I chose to block the hompage, r/all, and other subreddits' browse page using the [Less Distracting Reddit](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/less-distracting-reddit/) browser extension while still allowing me to read individual posts. This allows me to use Reddit like Stack Overflow. 

Abstaining from r/all, in particular, has drastically improved my mental well-being. The r/all page is a cesspool of the platform's most emotionally charged posts that inevitably makes me mad at the state of the world or the internet's villain of the day. I took the grill pill and ignored it all. I was happier for it. 

For other websites, I will throttle internet bandwidth to 1Kbps and block images by default. These changes make web browsing much less appealing. I'm allowed exceptions for work necessities. We'll see how that goes!
