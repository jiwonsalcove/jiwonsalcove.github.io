blurb: "I just got my bachelor's degree, so I wrote a listicle about it."

I just got my bachelor's degree! It was a long journey, including a semester when I only got F's. It's a miracle I got a degree at all, let alone with the opportunity to pursue a PhD next fall. Rather than writing an overly long retrospective that nobody cares about, I wrote a listicle instead! 

### Five Life Lessons I Wish I Knew Before Going to College

1. **Take care of your mental health.** If our mind breaks, then nothing else matters. 
2. **Be okay with not being the best.** Get used to the fact that you are not the best at everything you do, and that it's totally okay. That just means there's always people to learn from. 
3. **It's not too late.** Calm down! Don't rush or give up just because you're a couple of years behind others. 
4. **There are more resources than you think.** Make better use of office hours, mailing lists, student services, etc. 
5. **Don't overextend.** Take the recommended amount of courses, take on only a few extracurriculars, and do them well. 

### Ten Most Important Computer Science Concepts From Undergrad (In No Particular Order)

1. **The Von Neumann architecture.** The de facto computing architecture with a processing unit, control unit, memory (data + instructions), and I/O. 
2. **The Big-O Notation.** As computing problems often have massive problem sizes, asymptotic order of growth matters more than constant coefficients. 
3. **Complexity Classes.** Computing problems can be classified into different time and space complexity classes using the Big-O notation. Get used to P, NP, and DTIME. 
4. **The Church-Turing Thesis.** Wish some handwaving, the Church-Turing thesis posits that all feasible algorithms can be written as Turing's Turing Machines as well as Alonzo Church's Lambda Calculus. 
5. **Locality.** Memory locations that are spatially closer together tend to be accessed by a program closer together in time. Exploiting locality is one of the biggest systems-level optimizations. 
6. **Abstract data structures VS concrete data structures.** Lists, sets, queues, stacks, trees, graphs, and maps are abstract data structures that store data in a structured way to ease computation. Linked lists, array lists, hash tables, adjacency matrices, and sparse vectors are some ways to implement the abstract data structures. 
7. **Abstraction.** Computers are absurdly powerful and complex. As such, we organize them into layers of abstractions such that a single person only has to deal with one layer at a time. 
8. **Reductions.** Reductions allow us to transform one problem into another problem. By solving one theoretical problem, we can solve many others at the same time. 
9. **The time-space tradeoff.** In many scenarios, computer scientists make difficult problems feasible to solve within a reasonable amount of time by using more space (memory & storage), which tends to be cheaper than time. 
10. **Different fields view the same problem in different lenses.** Computer science includes subdisciplines whose practitioners think in wildly different ways, such as theory (algorithms & analysis), systems (empirical experiments), HCI (human factor), and data science (statistics). 

Many honorable mentions goes to: The greedy heuristic; search algorithms; minimax; finite automata, regular expressions and context-free grammar; duality; recursion; instructions as data; backpropagation; metaheuristics; the equivalence of logic, category theory and type theory; P vs NP problem.
