If you're as prone to addictions as I am, then you've certainly spent many days and nights doomscrolling or going on an online research spree. 

The **second survival strategy** is to follow the flowchart: **offline tools > online desktop apps > web browser > mobile apps.** 

**Mobile apps** are the worst since they are meticulously designed to maximize eyeball hours and minimize barrier to spending money. Only use if necessary for survival. 

**Web browsers** promote a bit more intentionality, but it is still very easy to fall into a rabbit hole of Youtube binges or online research sprees. Minimize time spent on a general-purpose web browser at all costs. Do NOT open up a web browser first thing in the morning. 

I even uninstall my web browser during long focus sessions, then reinstall later. This is easy on Linux, but not on Windows or macOS. 

**Desktop wrappers** for web apps are a bit better, since they do not allow you to open up any website instantly. Here are some examples:

* Use a [desktop calendar app](https://apps.gnome.org/Calendar/) instead of Google Calendar. 
* Use a text file or a locally stored word document instead of Google Sheets or Microsoft Office Online. 
* Use [Todoist Desktop](https://todoist.com/downloads) or [Ticktick Desktop](https://ticktick.com/about/download) for task management. 
* Use Discord app instead of discord.com; use Slack app instead of slack.com; etc. 
* Use [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) instead of github.com. 
* Use a desktop email client instead of web Gmail. 

If a web app doesn't have a pre-existing desktop wrapper, then you can create one using tools like [Webapp Manager](https://github.com/linuxmint/webapp-manager) or [WebCatalog](https://webcatalog.io/). Web apps created in this manner are still a web browser under the hood, but they hide UI elements that make it super easy to jump to any website. 

**Entirely offline alternatives** are even better than desktop apps that still need some internet connection. These apps allow me to go completely offline. Here are some suggestions:

* Download Wikipedia (roughly 100Gb) using [Kiwix](https://kiwix.org/). 
* Download programming language documentations using [Zeal](https://zealdocs.org/). 
* Download reading materials then send it to an e-reader or print them out. 
* Download music locally; you can buy DRM-free music from [Bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com/) or [Amazon Digital Music](https://www.amazon.com/MP3-Music-Download/b?ie=UTF8&node=163856011). 
* Write LaTeX documents locally using [Overleaf Git integration](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/how-to/Git_Integration_and_GitHub_Synchronization) and a [desktop editor](https://www.texstudio.org/). 
* Develop software locally when possible. 
* Buy physical copies of reference books. 
* Learn how to read man pages and consider using [tldr.sh](https://tldr.sh/).
