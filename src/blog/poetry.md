I listen to a wide range of music, from rock and metal to some synthwave, hiphop and and K-pop. So while I'm not a genre purist, there is a common "vibe" among my favorite artists in that they put a lot of attention into the lyrics of their songs and aim to be more "poetic" than the norm of their genre. 

I also like it when artists write about topics that aren't the same tired love song trope. 

Essentially, this is the post in which I vibe to the lyricism of my favorite songs and artists. 

### Poets of the Fall

Of course, my favorite rock band of all time are self-proclaimed poets. Who else would I listen to? This alternative rock and rock ballad band is known for their songs [War](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7OF6j5hI4I) and [The Poet and the Muse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLxb7m0j5Jg) which were featured in the game [Alan Wake](https://www.alanwake.com/). 

While the two Alan Wake songs are excellent, I want to highlight their lesser known classic [Locking Up the Sun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9vHb2WRlwI).

> It's a bad trip on a sinking ship, when no-one seems responsible
> Scapegoat to rock the boat, yeah, we need someone expendable
> ...
> Is there a hero somewhere, someone who appears and saves the day
> Someone who holds out a hand and turns back time

Clearly, the authors are talking about how people react with societal crisis - sinking ships - in toxic ways, by either pointing their fingers to a "scapegoat" or blindly waiting for a "hero" who will fix the problems. Yet the author points out that such scapegoat or hero does not exist. 

> And in the emptiness...

Instead, the only way to solve such problems is collective action. 

> Just lookwithin yourself for absolution

### MC Sniper

MC Sniper is a relatively obscure first-generation Korean rapper from the 90s, and someone who describes himself as a lyrical poet. I like his lyrical style of singing rap and his subject matter. His songs include tired love song tropes but also includes societal issues, disasters, and the perspective of life from a 40-something-year-old solely missing from the "Oh I'm so Rich and I Fuck Bitches" kind of rap songs. 

One of my favorites is Night Flight, as it exemplifie his perspective as a now middle aged family man that he didn't realize in his youth. I'll just translate a whole section which speaks for itself.

> Time is short when in you're in love
> While tears are short in heartbreak
> Life is seeing things that you didn't see
> while you were in love, after the breakup

> When I was young, I counted the stars
> As an adult, I count only bills
> If I bleach the grimes in my heart
> will it also erase my concerns

> I see my mother's hesitation
> re-checking the price of the sweater
> She couldn't buy it with 12-month installments
> She kitted overnight instead

> As she had done, I so will do
> As life is like, I so will feel
> I bet my life to protect my dreams
> But to dream again, I must discard my dreams

### Cavetown

This young pop singer has become sort of a transmasc icon. I like his song, though the song that I jam to the most is, by far, Home.

It talks about the guilt of being mentally unstable and needing special attention. 

> Often, I am upset that I can not fall in love, but I guess
> This avoids the stress of falling out of it
> Are you tired of me yet?
> I'm a little sick right now, but I swear
> When I'm ready, I will fly us out of here

The struggles of learning how to perform a new role and the difficult self-discovery process. 

> Get a load of this monster
> He doesn't know how to communicate
> His mind is in a different place
> Will everybody please give him a little bit of space?
> Get a load of this train wreck
> His hair's a mess and he doesn't know who he is yet

And the truth that there is nothing wrong with him, and that he will find a home. 

> But little do we know, the stars
> Welcome him with open arms
