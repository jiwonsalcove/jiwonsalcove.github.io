Most species of forget-me-nots (_Myosotis sp._) are non-native to North America. This colony, which occupies wide swaths of my back yard through its rhizomous spread, is most likely the highly invasive _Myosotis scorpiodes_ from Europe, which has become commonplace around here in the Great Lakes region. I will most likely need to resort to herbicidal control. It's a shame, since it is quite the pretty flower.
