Physical bookstores have that magic of picking up random books that I never would have found from an online review.

I found several gems on this haul for about $10 total.
* [Imagining Iraq: Literature in English and the Iraq Invasion](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1057/9780230298118)
* [How Everything Can Collapse: A Manual for our Times](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/How+Everything+Can+Collapse%3A+A+Manual+for+our+Times-p-9781509541393)
* [After the Post-Cold War: The Future of Chinese History](https://www.dukeupress.edu/after-the-post-cold-war)
