Paper will be published in VLDBJ after editing processes are complete. 

This work was made possible thanks to my collaborator Bohan Cui, authors of the original conference paper Fatemeh Nargesian, Abolfazl Asudeh, and H.V. Jagadish, and the Schwartz Discover Grant for Undergraduate Research. 

Our journal paper significantly extends upon the conference paper with new and modified analysis and algorithms. 

I will also publish additional materials (e.g. laymen's abstract, poster) about our work soon.
