Common yarrows are one of the few native, large, perennial flowering plants that I found in my back yard growing on its own. The colony just blooomed, which attracted quite the selection of bugs. I observed many adult and larval ladybugs, some native-looking flies and bees. It reminds me why I am doing this project in the first place.
